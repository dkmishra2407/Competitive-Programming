**For a number to be divisible by 11, the difference of the sum of numbers at even and odd places should be either 0 or a multiple of 11.
What is the unit\'s digit in the product (267)153 x (66666)72 

**Dividend = (Divisor x Quotient) + Remainder

**Two numbers are in the ratio of 5:7. If their LCM is 105, what is the difference between their squares ?

Let \'h\' be the HCF of the two numbers. => The numbers are 5h and 7h. We know that Product of Numbers = LCM x HCF => 5h x 7h = 105 x h => h = 3 So, the numbers are 15 and 21. 

**Nth term of the G.P is represented as Tn = a x rn-1

**If the average of four consecutive odd numbers is 16, TAKE x,x+2,x+4,x+6

**First, list down the factors of 32 and 14. (HCF-Highest Common Factor)

The factors of 32 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
The factors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, 14
We can see that 1, 2 are the only common factors of 32 and 14. Whereas 2 is the greatest among all the common factors.
Hence, HCF of 32 and 14 is 2.

**LCM 
Multiples of 3: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24…
Multiples of 4: 4,8,12,16,20,24, 28…
The common multipliers of 3 and 4 are 12, 24…, So, the least common multiple is 12.

Hence, LCM(3, 4) = 12

**Find the largest four-digit number exactly divisible by 15,21 and 28. 

Solution:

The largest four-digit number is 9999. 

Now, LCM (15, 21, 28) = 420 On dividing 9999 by 420, we get 339 as the remainder. 

Therefore, the required number is 9999-339 = 9660 


**The sum of two numbers is 1001, and their HCF is 7. Find the numbers.

a + b = 1001 (Sum of the two numbers)
HCF(a, b) = 7

We know that if the HCF of two numbers divides their sum, then it also divides the difference of the two numbers.

So, a – b is divisible by 7.

** Find the LCM of 12, 18, and 24.

Answer:

12 = 22 × 3
18 = 2 × 32
24 = 23 × 3
Now, to find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:

The highest power of 2 is 23.
The highest power of 3 is 32.
Multiplying these together gives us:

LCM = 23 × 32 = 8 × 9 = 72


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////  WORK  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

M1 D1 H1 E1 / W1 = M2 D2 H2 E2 / W2, where 
M = Number of workers 
D = Number of days 
H = Number of working hours in a day 
E = Efficiency of workers 
W = Units of work

***Two friends A and B are employed to do a piece of work in 18 days. If A is twice as efficient as B, find the time taken by each friend to do the work alone. 
Solution: 

Let the efficiency of B be 1 unit / day. 
=> Efficiency of A = 2 unit / day. 
=> Combined efficiency of A and B = 2+1 = 3 units / day 
=> Total work = No. of Days x Efficiency = 18 days x 3 units / day = 54 units 
Therefore, time required by A to complete the work alone = 54/2 = 27 days 
Time required by B to complete the work alone = 54/1 = 54 days


**Two friends A and B were employed to do a work. Initial deadline was fixed at 24 days. Both started working together but after 20 days, A left the work and the whole work took 30 days to complete. In how much time can B alone can do the work?
Explanation :
Let the total work be 24 units. It is given that A and B together can do the work in 24 days. => Combined efficiency of A and B = 24/24 = 1 unit / day => Work done in 20 days = 20 units => Work left = 24 - 20 = 4 units Now, this remaining 4 units of work was done by B alone in 10 days. => Efficiency of B = 4/10 = 0.4 Therefore, time required by B alone to do the work = 24/0.4 = 60 days


**600 men can make a road in 500 days. They start working together but after every hundred days, 50 men leave the work. Find the total time (in days) it takes to make the road.
-->  TOTAL WORK = mens * no of days 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  COMPOUND INTEREST //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**Amount, A = P [1 + (R / 100)]n, where P is the principal, R is the rate of interest per unit time period and n is the time period.
**Compound Interest, CI = Amount – Principal
If the compounding period is not annual, the rate of interest is divided in accordance with the compounding period. For example, if interest is compounded half-yearly, then the rate of interest would be R / 2, where ‘R’ is the annual rate of interest.
If interest is compounded daily, the rate of interest = R / 365 and A = P [ 1 + ( {R / 365} / 100 ) ]T, where ‘T’ is the time period. For example, if we have to calculate the interest for 1 year, then T = 365. For 2 years, T = 730.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   CALENDER   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

To determine the day of the week for a specific date, we use the concept of “odd days”. Odd days refer to the extra or remaining days in a given period that exceeded complete weeks. For example, if a month has 30 days, there are two odd days because two days exceed four complete weeks. It is important to understand this concept when working with calendars and scheduling events on specific dates.

Finding days from dates is based on calculating the number of odd days. By odd days, we mean a number of days more than a complete number of weeks. 
For example, the number of days in a non-leap year = 365 365 mod 7 = 1 So, the number of odd days in a non-leap year = 1
Number of days in a leap year = 366 => Number of odd days in a leap year = 366 mod 7 = 2
Number of odd days in 100 years (76 non-leap years + 24 leap years) = [(76 x 1) + (24 x 2)] mod 7 = (76 + 48) mod 7 = 124 mod 7 = 5 days
Number of odd days in 200 years = (2 x Number of odd days in 100 years) mod 7 = 10 mod 7 = 3
Number of odd days in 300 years = (3 x 5) mod 7 = 1
Number of odd days in 400 years = (4 x 5 + 1) mod 7 = 21 mod 7 = 0 Note that here, we have added 1 day extra because the 400th year would itself be a leap year.


To solve this problem, we need to count the number of days between January 1st, 2023, and October 31st, 2023, and then find out what day of the week October 31st, 2023 falls on. Total number of days between January 1st, 2023, and October 31st, 2023 = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 304 Now, we can find out what day of the week October 31st, 2023 falls on by adding 304 days to Sunday, which is the day of the week on January 1st, 2023. 304 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 2, which means that 304 days after Sunday is two days after Sunday, which is Tuesday. Therefore, October 31st, 2023 is on a Tuesday.

**1600 will have 0 odd days. 300 years will have 1 odd day. Now, in the next 99 years, we would be having 75 non-leap years and 24 leap years.

1.The minute hand covers 360 degrees in 60 minutes. => In 1 minute, the minute hand covers 360 / 60 = 6 degrees
2.The hour hand covers 360 degrees in 12 hours. => In 1 hour, the hour hand covers 360 / 12 = 30 degrees => In 1 minute, the hour hand covers 30 / 60 = 0.50 degrees
3.In every hour, the minute hand and the hour hand coincide once
4.The angle between the minute hand and the hour hand increases by 5.50 degrees every minute
5.In every hour, the minute hand and the hour hand coincide once.
6.If the minute hand and the hour hand are in the same line, then the angle between them is either 0 degree or 180 degrees.


**Find the angle between the hands of a clock at 3:20 PM.
-->
 At 3:00 PM, the angle made by the minute hand = 0 degree,

 and the angle made by the hour hand = 3 x angle made by the hour hand in one hour = 3 x 30 = 90 degrees => Initial angle between the two hands = 90 degrees Now, we know that the difference between the two hands of the clock increases every minute by 5.50 degrees. => Difference between the hands of the clock after 20 minutes = 20 x 5.50 = 110 degrees Therefore, the difference between the two hands at 3:20 PM = 110 – 90 = 20 degrees.
